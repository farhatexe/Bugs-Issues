Thanks for purchasing Metronic 3.0.2 and joining our awesome community!

IMPORTANT!:
Plupload plugin's(plupload.com) examples folder has a vulnerable script upload.php which does not check uploading file extenstions before save it in disk and with a little hack there can be possibility to upload executable scripts to a server. In this v3.0.2 quick release we have upgraded the plupload plugin with the latest available version(v2.1.2) and excluded/removed the examples folder so if you use this plugin you will need to implement the server side upload handler script yourself with file extension validation. if you don't use this plugin you don't have to take any action and still be safe. If you are using Metronic's older versions(v2.x or v3.0.1) then you just need to remove the current plupload plugin's folder from the assets folder and replace it with the one from v3.0.2. Don't worry v3.1 still on strack to be released in a few days.
